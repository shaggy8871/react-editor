## How It Was Done

The application was built using [Cursor](https://cursor.com) through a combination of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o models. The tool was prompted with instructions such as "Write me a function that..." or "This code isn't working as expected, here are the rules I need you to follow...".

Sometimes the models required more than a simple description of the outcome desired, and instead required a specific suggestion for how to solve the problem (e.g. "Have you considered using anchorNode and focusNode to find what you're looking for?"). However all of the code was written by the models themselves.
